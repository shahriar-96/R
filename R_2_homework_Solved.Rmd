Download this R Markdown file, save it on your computer, and perform all the below tasks by inserting your answer in text or by inserting R chunks below. After you are done, upload this file with your solutions on Moodle.

## Exercise 1

a) Create an R chunk here to insert R code. Add R code in this R chunk to perform a simple calculation (e.g. calculate the sum of 1 and 2).

```{r}
x = 6
y = 7
z = x * y

z
```
b) Create an R chunk with a basic calculation (e.g. 1+1). Try out the different ways how to include this in the knitted report.\

Assume,\
 x = 11 and\
 y = 12\

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
x = 11
y = 12
z= x * y

z
```
1. The result of multiplication of x and y is `r z`.\
2. x + y equals `r x + y`.\
3. x / y yields `r x/y`.\
  

c) Knit this Rmd file to html and to pdf.

The htlm and pdf is exported and included with the assignment.


## Exercise 2: Manipulating variables and data frames

Load the Pima Indian dataset:

```{r}
dat_ex2 <- read.csv(file = url("https://www.dropbox.com/s/tqrauwuxyi03kee/Pima_diabetes.csv?dl=1"))
```

and answer the following questions:

```{r}
# How many women have Glucose levels 0?

#sum(dat_ex2$Glucose == 0)
nrow(dat_ex2[dat_ex2$Glucose == 0,])
# How many women have Insulin levels 0?

nrow(dat_ex2[dat_ex2$Insulin == 0,])

# How many women have both Glucose levels as well as Insulin levels 0?

nrow(dat_ex2[dat_ex2$Glucose == 0 & dat_ex2$Insulin ==0,])

# How many women have either Glucose levels or Insulin levels 0?

sum(dat_ex2$Glucose == 0 | dat_ex2$Insulin ==0)

# How many women have missing BMI values?

sum(is.na(dat_ex2$BMI))

# How many women have BMI larger than 40?

sum(dat_ex2$BMI > 40)

# Build a dataset that only includes the women with BMI>40

dat_sub = dat_ex2[dat_ex2$BMI>40,]
dat_sub

# Create a new variable named BMIOutlier, which has the value 0 if a women has BMI smaller or equal 50, and 1 if she has BMI higher than 50

dat_sub["BMIOutlier"] = ifelse(dat_sub$BMI<=50,0,1)
dat_sub
```

## Exercise 3 (optional)

Explore merging two datasets.

As a preparation, execute the following code to create different data frames

```{r}
# import data
dat_ex3 <- read.csv(file = url("https://www.dropbox.com/s/tqrauwuxyi03kee/Pima_diabetes.csv?dl=1"))

# extract two smaller data sets
dat3_1 <- dat_ex3[1:100, 1:3]
dat3_2 <- dat_ex3[101:300, 1:3]

dat3_3 <- dat_ex3[1:100, 1:3]
dat3_4 <- dat_ex3[1:100, 4:6]
```

Task 3a: Think about how you can use the [.] operator to respectively piece dat3_1 and dat3_2, and dat3_3 and dat3_4 together into one data frame.

Task 3b: Explore the help of the merge() function in R in order to achieve the same goal of combining dat3_3 and dat3_4 together into one data frame. Hint: first create an ID variable in each data frame, then use this in the "by" argument.

## Exercise 4 (optional): Times and dates in R

Create an Excel file with 5 observations of 2 variables. Variable 1 is just an ID variable (number 1-5 or character string etc.), and variable 2 is a date/time variable. Use variable 2 to describe the time (and day) you had lunch in the last 5 days. Then try to import the Excel file with both variables into R and/or transform the variables in R to Date or POSIXct variables.
