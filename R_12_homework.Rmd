## Exercise 1: Linear mixed model for hierarchical data

Load the HRS dataset and do the following preparations:

```{r}
library(readr)
dat_link <- url("https://www.dropbox.com/s/z281ijk81ohyg9v/hrs.RData?dl=1")
load(dat_link)

# Preparations
# rename variable at first timepoint
names(hrs)[5] <- "R1IMRC"
# define variable at second timepoint - Integrate the variables R2AIMRC10 and R2HIMRC20, which both capture different subgroups of the sample at the second timepoint.
table(is.na(hrs$R2AIMRC10)) # -> only ~7000 of ~36000 observations
table(is.na(hrs$R2HIMRC20)) # -> only ~10000 of ~36000 observations
table(!is.na(hrs$R2HIMRC20) & !is.na(hrs$R2AIMRC10)) # -> no person has a value at both variables, i.e. the variables complement each other
hrs$R2IMRC <- rowSums( cbind (hrs$R2AIMRC10, hrs$R2HIMRC20), na.rm=TRUE)
hrs$R2IMRC[!(!is.na(hrs$R2HIMRC20) | !is.na(hrs$R2AIMRC10))] <- NA
table(is.na(hrs$R2IMRC))
# Rescale R1IMRC and R2IMRC onto the same scale as all other variables (measures 3-12 were on a scale of 1-10, measures 1-2 on the scale 1-20)
hrs$R1IMRC <- hrs$R1IMRC/2
hrs$R2IMRC <- hrs$R2IMRC/2

# Extract variables for first investigation
data_IMRC <- data.frame(HHID = hrs$HHID, PN = hrs$PN, HHID_PN = paste(hrs$HHID, hrs$PN, sep = "_"),
                        T1 = hrs$R1IMRC, T2 = hrs$R2IMRC, T3 = hrs$R3IMRC, T4 = hrs$R4IMRC, T5 = hrs$R5IMRC, T6 = hrs$R6IMRC,
                        T7 = hrs$R7IMRC, T8 = hrs$R8IMRC, T9 = hrs$R9IMRC, T10 = hrs$R10IMRC, T11 = hrs$R11IMRC, T12 = hrs$R12IMRC)
```

Answer the following questions: 

a) How many observations are there in the dataset?

#Specifically, the dataset has 36167 observations.

b) How many households are there in the dataset (observations are clustered in households)?

```{r}
length(unique(data_IMRC$HHID))

#The dataset includes 22996 households.
```

c) Now, compute a linear regression model to predict T2 by T1, i.e. the cognitive performance at the second timepoint by the cognitive performance at the first timepoint. Also, compute two linear mixed models, one with random intercept, one with random intercept+slope to predict T2 by T1. Compare the results, i.e. the estimated effect of T1 on T2. Are they similar, or are they very different?

```{r}
# Computation of linear regression model to predict T2 by T1
fit1 <- lm(T2 ~ T1, data = data_IMRC)
summary(fit1)
pred.fit1 <- predict(fit1)

# Predicted values:
head(pred.fit1)

#When comparing two performance whose cognitive performance at T1 differs by 1, their cognitive performance at T2 varies, on average, by 0.53. Also the R-squared value is 0.2091.
```
```{r}
#Computation of two linear mixed models, one with random intercept
library(nlme)
fit2 <- lme(T2 ~ T1, random = ~1|HHID, na.action = na.exclude, data = data_IMRC)
summary(fit2)
pred.fit2 <- predict(fit2)

# Predicted values:
head(pred.fit2)

#With random intercept this model is almost similar to the first model however it is better from the first one. The predicted values are different in comparison to the actual ones.
```
```{r}
# Computation of linear mixed model with random slope
library(nlme)
fit <- lme(T2 ~ T1, random = ~T1|HHID, na.action = na.exclude, data = data_IMRC)
summary(fit)
pred.fit <- predict(fit)

# Predicted values:
head(pred.fit)

#The best outcomes of the three came from including the slope in the model. Overall, the model from above produced quite similar findings in terms of the estimate of the fixed effect.
```
